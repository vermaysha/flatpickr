## Supported Versions
| Package Version | Supported Filament Version(s) |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| v2.x             | Filament v2                  |
| v3.x             | Filament v3                  |
| v4.x             | Filament v3, Filament v4     |

## Installation

Install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require coolsam/flatpickr
```

Run the installation command to publish the assets and config file:

```bash
php artisan flatpickr:install
```
This will publish the config file to `config/flatpickr.php` and the assets to `public/vendor/flatpickr`. The command will also ask you if you would like to overwrite the existing assets and config files if they exist.
If you choose to overwrite, the existing files will be replaced with the new ones. This is useful if you want to update the package to the latest version there have been changes to the config file or assets in the latest version.

If you are upgrading from a previous version be sure to run the following to ensure assets are up to date
```bash
php artisan filament:upgrade
```

## Usage
You can do a lot with just one Component: `Flatpickr`
You can use the Flatpickr component from this package as:
* DatePicker
* TimePicker
* DateTimePicker
* Range Picker
* Week Picker,
* Multiple-Date Picker
* Month Picker

Most of the fluent config methods are similar to [Flatpickr's official](https://flatpickr.js.org/options/) options in naming.

This package is also an extension of [Filament's DateTimePicker](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/forms/fields/date-time-picker), so most of the methods are similar to the ones in the DateTimePicker component. You can use the Flatpickr component as a drop-in replacement for the DateTimePicker component.

Here are some examples of the methods. Refer to Flatpickr's Official Documentation for details on each of the configurations.

```php
use Coolsam\FilamentFlatpickr\Forms\Components\Flatpickr;

// Basic, Date Field
Flatpickr::make('test_field') // Minimal Config as a datepicker
Flatpickr::make('test_field')
    ->allowInput() // Allow a user to manually input the date in the textbox (make the textbox editable)
    ->altInput(true) // Enable the use of Alternative Input (See Flatpickr docs)
    ->altFormat('F j, Y') // Alternative input format
    ->time(true) // Turn this into a DateTimePicker
    ->disabledDates(['2023-07-25','2023-07-26']) // Disable specific dates from being selected.
    ->minDate(fn() => today()->startOfYear()) // Set the minimum allowed date
    ->maxDate(fn() => today()) // Set the maximum allowed date.
    ->hourIncrement(1) // Intervals of incrementing hours in a time picker
    ->minuteIncrement(10) // Intervals of minute increment in a time picker
    ->seconds(false) // Enable seconds in a time picker
    ->defaultSeconds(0) //Initial value of the seconds element, when no date is selected 
    ->defaultMinute(0) // Initial value of the minutes element, when no date is selected
    ->allowInvalidPreload() // Initially check if the selected date is valid
    ->altInputClass('sample-class') // Add a css class for the alt input format
    ->format('Y-m-d') // Set the main date format
    ->ariaDateFormat('Y-m-d') // Aria
    ->clickOpens(true) // Open the datepicker when the input is clicked.
    ->closeOnSelect(true) // Close the datepicker once the date is selected.
    ->conjunction(',') // Applicable only for the MultiDatePicker: Separate inputs using this conjunction. The package will use this conjunction to explode the inputs to an array.
    ->inline(true) // Display the datepicker inline with the input, instead of using a popover.
    ->disableMobile(true) // Disable mobile-version of the datepicker on mobile devices.
    ->mode(\Coolsam\FilamentFlatpickr\Enums\FlatpickrMode::RANGE) // Set the mode as single, range or multiple. Alternatively, you can just use ->range() or ->multiple()
    ->monthSelectorType(\Coolsam\FilamentFlatpickr\Enums\FlatpickrMonthSelectorType::DROPDOWN)
    ->shorthandCurrentMonth(true)
    ->noCalendar(true) // use this in conjunction with `time()` to have a timePicker
    ->position(\Coolsam\FilamentFlatpickr\Enums\FlatpickrPosition::AUTO_CENTER)
    ->showMonths(1)
    ->weekNumbers(true)
    ->time24hr(true)
    ->timePicker() // Configure a timepicker out of the box
    ->weekPicker() // configure a week picker out of the box
    ->monthPicker() // configure a month picker out of the box
    ->rangePicker() // configure a date range picker out of the box
    ->multiplePicker() // Configure a multiple date picker out of the box
;
```

## Examples
```php
// You can also use the component as a DateTimePicker, Range Picker, Week Picker, Month Picker, TimePicker and Multiple Date Picker
\Coolsam\Flatpickr\Forms\Components\Flatpickr::make('start_time')->timePicker(),
\Coolsam\Flatpickr\Forms\Components\Flatpickr::make('week_number')->weekPicker()->format('W Y'),
\Coolsam\Flatpickr\Forms\Components\Flatpickr::make('month')->monthPicker()->format('Y-m')->displayFormat('F Y'),
\Coolsam\Flatpickr\Forms\Components\Flatpickr::make('range')->rangePicker(),
\Coolsam\Flatpickr\Forms\Components\Flatpickr::make('occupied_slots')->multiplePicker()->format('Y-m-d')->displayFormat('F j, Y'),
```

## Flatpickr Themes (See [Flatpickr Docs](https://flatpickr.js.org/themes/) for more Details)
> **Note:** I highly recommend that you use the DEFAULT theme, which is styled using tailwind to conform to the filament design system. The other themes come with the flatpickr javascript package and may not conform to your Filament themeing, including dark mode.

You can set the package's theme globally under the `theme` config  in the `config/flatpickr.php` file. The config accepts a `\Coolsam\Flatpickr\Enums\FlatpickrTheme` enum value.
The `\Coolsam\Flatpickr\Enums\FlatpickrTheme::DEFAULT` theme is already set by default and conforms to the filament design system.

```php
use Coolsam\FilamentFlatpickr\Enums\FlatpickrTheme;
return [
    'theme' => FlatpickrTheme::AIRBNB,
];
```
See the screenshots below for the different themes.

## State Types
The package supports the following state types:
- `string` or `CarbonInterface` for DateTimePicker, DatePicker, TimePicker, WeekPicker, MonthPicker
- `array` for RangePicker, MultiplePicker (an array of date strings or CarbonInterface instances)
